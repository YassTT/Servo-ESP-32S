# Servo-ESP-32S


I created an Arduino ESP32 script that makes the servo motor move in a cycle. I also built an HTML interface on GitHub that allows me to control the servo freely.

With this interface, I can:

Start or stop the servo cycle

Stop the servo at any moment

Control the servo position manually during the cycle
Since the last script, I've improved the interface to make it visually more appealing.
